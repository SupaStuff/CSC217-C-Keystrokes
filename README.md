# C++ Keystrokes #

### What is this repository for? ###

This repo contains the stuff we will be working on for CSC217 simulation project.

### How do I get set up? ###

* git clone https://github.com/SupaStuff/CSC217-C-Keystrokes.git
* Compile and run winKeyLogger if you or someone else coding are on a Windows.
* Otherwise, use {,g}vim file_name.cpp -w key.log.
* If you can, use this Vim command on Windows instead of the key logger.
* If you aren't using Windows or Vim, idk what to tell you.
* Do some C++ coding or something. Finish a project while logging your key presses.
* Place the file in the corresponding log folder in the repository.
* We'll work on a program that computes the frequency of each key press and some other stuff.
* Ultimate goal is to randomly generate C++ code based on these frequencies.

make doesn't compile winKeyLogger.cpp since it only works on Windows.
You can uncomment #SOURCES := $(wildcard *.cpp) if you want to compile it and you are on Windows.
